In this particular case, typescript isn't replacing a language per say, it is acting as an additional add-on. From what I've been reading, typescript is essentially javascript but with some additional features. It is a superset of javascript with the main addition being the inclusion of a strongly typed system, like other programming languages. It contains all the components of javascript, and code can be compiled between the two, but it also has ability to declare strongly typed variables.

When the codebase is large or when there are multiple developers working on a larger project. The introduction of strong typing allows for some of the more common mistakes to be avoided, and the transipler (moving between javascript and typescript) will probably catch a lot of errors and make the process of debugging a bit smoother. At a broader team level, it might be better to use Typescript if the team is more used to strongly typed languages like C# or Java. There are also some performance implications to using typescript over javascript. On a conceptual level, typescript acts as an upgrade by reducing the frequency of errors from using javascript.
